# SkyStore: Your gateway to the best dApps on Skynet.

SkyStore is the definitive place for discovering community-created apps within [Skynet](https://siasky.net), a decentralized web protocol by [Sia](https://sia.tech). As an improved iteration of an existing project, the [Skynet AppStore](https://github.com/skynethubio/SkyAppStore) (using the same API at skynethub-api.herokuapp.com/skapps), SkyStore presents a sleek, hand-crafted user interface complete with filtering, search, and the added ability to choose the Skynet Portal from which to launch a Skynet app. Also... there are animated clouds!
